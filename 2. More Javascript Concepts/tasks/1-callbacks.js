/*
More Javascript Concepts: Callbacks, Timeouts and Intervals

Task:
	1. Define a function `callbackExecute` which takes two arguments, `message` and `callback`
	The function must first display the message and then execute the callback after 2 seconds.

	2. Define a function `timer` which takes in two arguments, `time` and `tick`
	Define a variable `count` with the initial value `0`.
	The timer will run for `time` seconds and every `tick` seconds, the `count` increases.
	Display the value of `count` at every tick. Once the time runs out, the program must stop executing.
