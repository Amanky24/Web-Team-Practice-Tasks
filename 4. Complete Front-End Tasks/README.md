# Complete Frontend Tasks
> ees-iitkgp/Web-Team-Practice-Tasks

## Instructions:
Each task in the `tasks` folder will be written in a HTML file as a comment. There will be no boilerplate HTML and CSS like in the previous tasks.

- Start writing the HTML tag content after the comment containing the task. Do NOT delete the comment.
- All styles and scripts used will be in the same HTML file only. Usage of additional script files or stylesheets is not permitted.
- Usage of any third-party framwork/library like Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, etc. is strictly prohibited. You will only be using HTML, CSS and JS, all in the same file.
- Ideally it is preferred that you do not use inline CSS, unless it concerns a very small inline CSS.
